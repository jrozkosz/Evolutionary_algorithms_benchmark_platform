Subject: CEC 2022 R bindings

Dear P. N. Suganthan, 

I have extended {cecs} package with an interface from R to CEC 2022 SO-BO functions written in C. 
The package should be available on CRAN in a few days. Otherwise, it may be installed via {devtools} package
directly from GitHub.

If you think it is valid and useful, feel free to utilize it. 

Best Regards
Eryk Warchulski
