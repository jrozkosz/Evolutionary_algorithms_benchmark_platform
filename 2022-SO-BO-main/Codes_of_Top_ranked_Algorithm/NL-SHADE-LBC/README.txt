A short readme on how to compile and run the code of NL-SHADE-LBC for CEC 2022 benchmark functions.

All the code of the NL-SHADE-LBC is contained in "nl_shade_lbc.cpp" file.
For compilation you will also need "cec22_test_func.cpp", provided by the competition organizers.
To run the code, you will need the "input_data" folder, containing the functions shift and rotation data, as well as random seeds.

The basic compilation is simple using gcc/g++:

g++ -std=c++11 -O3 nl_shade_lbc.cpp -o nl_shade_lbc.exe

You may try to decrease execution time by adding hardware-specific commands:

g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -march=corei7-avx nl_shade_lbc.cpp -o nl_shade_lbc.exe

Please note that the compilation requires support of C++11 standard.
This will create nl_shade_lbc.exe, available for running.
The program will first run time complexity tests on your machine, writing results into "time_complexity.txt"
You may edit the .cpp file to switch it off.
Next, the main optimization loop will be started, writing data to "NL-SHADE-RSP_(F)_(DIM)D.txt", where F and DIM are the function number and problem dimension.
As long as the the random seeds are fixed, the results should always be the same.
